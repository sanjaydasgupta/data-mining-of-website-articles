# Data-Mining Website Articles

Many websites publish articles or stories periodically. 
Good examples of such sites are [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/) and [NL Times](https://nltimes.nl/). 
Unfortunately, new articles are appear regularly, and replace the earlier stories on the website's main page. 

This notebook shows ways of data-mining such websites to obtain a summary of all the stories published earlier 
(but are no longer visible on the main page).
